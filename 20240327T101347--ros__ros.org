ROS (Robot Operating System) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

* Story with ros at university time

I first know ROS almost 10 years ago I think.

- I used /raspberry pi/ as mobile compute platform. running =ubuntu 16.04= i think.
- use a laser ladar

But after that, I didn't use it for a long time. And I thing I don't really ever understand it.
