PCB design tool.

* my experience for my first pcb design
+ as a leaner, first thing is choose a small project as a start. I tried space mouse, keyword. Finnally I choose a simpler one, a 1x2 keypad. Just used to replace page up and page down key.
+ I used kicad, it is a open source tool, and it is free. I used it on my macbook pro. It is a little bit slow, but it is ok.
+ manufacture is a little bit difficult. I used jlcpcb, it is a chinese manufacture. I have to convert the kicad file to gerber file, and then upload to the website. It is a little bit difficult for me. I have to google a lot to find the right way to do it.
