I'm Felix Murray Tang, and I welcome you to my digital realm! As an innovator, creator, and lifelong learner, this space reflects my passions, projects, and the endless curiosity that drives me. I'm a multifaceted individual with a deep love for technology, nature, and knowledge.

This website contains various content inside the =/node/= directory. The main subjects are:

- [[/notes/][notes]]
- [[/articles/][articles]]
- [[/projects/][projects]]

I also plan to record [[/podcasts/][podcasts]] and [[/videos/][videos]].

* What I'm Doing

My current endeavors span across software, hardware, and personal growth:

In the software realm, I'm crafting this website using Astro, with a focus on content creation. I'm also mastering =FreeBSD= for server management and advanced networking, while integrating my entire workflow into ~Emacs~ to embrace simplicity.

On the hardware front, I've recently completed my first custom PCB design using =KiCad=, which has been an exciting milestone. I'm also exploring 3D printing and modeling with FreeCAD, and dabbling in robotics with plans to dive deeper into ROS in the near future.

Personal growth is a significant part of my journey. I've committed to reading daily for at least an hour as a long-term project. To maintain an active lifestyle, I run 30km weekly and embark on monthly long trail runs or hikes. In terms of content creation, I write daily notes and articles, and I'm planning to launch a YouTube channel soon, so stay tuned!
