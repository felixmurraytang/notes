freebsd is my new base os. i love it because,

1. clean, full
   not like linux + gnu + others. freebsd base system on a single repository. which made clean and find the source code very easy.
2. ~IDS~
   =freebsd-update IDS=
   i love the feeling that i can totally control my os.
   i can know where each file on os from easily which is difficult to do that on linux distribution.
3. [[denote:20240919T213711][zfs]]
   
what i use.

* [[denote:20240916T194730][jails]]
primary method to deploy software or any other tasks.

** [[denote:20240916T211626][bhyve]]
i use bhyve inside jails becasue i what bhyve only used as jail's fallback.

* [[denote:20240923T055548][pf]]
firewall that i think is easier then iptables.

* pkg
the most clear package management i used.

*** the only package i used are ~doas~ and ~tmux~.
*** TODO learn how to pack software
