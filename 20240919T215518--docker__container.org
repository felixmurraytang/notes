docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

* why?
the first tool i used to try to isolate software. but i failed.
the final isolation method i use is freebsd jails.

* architecture
i need learn deeper. it is a good way to learn linux kernel. because docker used many kernel features such as cgroups, namespaces, etc which i don't really understand.
