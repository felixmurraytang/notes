I have chosen LXD as my virtualization and isolation solution because it's exceptionally suited for creating development sandboxes. Its ability to quickly test something in an isolated environment is a major advantage. Additionally, it's lightweight compared to a full virtual machine, with the creation of an LXC container taking just a few seconds through a single command.

I use LXD to do such things on my poor 4 CPU, 16 GiB Ausus Mini PC PB62. I already create more than total 50 container and virtual machine (about 5).

- Private Git service, and CI/CD solution with =Gitea= and =Gitea runner=
- Private Kubernetes soltions with =MicroK8s= HA Cluster
- Database services
  Monitor services
- Development environments
- Test envionments

However, there are some disadvantages to note:

- Running it similarly to Docker, Podman, or MicroK8s may require additional configurations. To keep things simple, I use the ~--vm~ option with LXD to create a full virtual machine instead of the default container.
- LXD seems to be officially supported only through ~Snap~, which might not be very common. However, this point is less of a concern for me personally, especially since Ubuntu is my favorite Linux distribution (excluding specialized distributions like Gentoo, Guix, or LFS ðŸ˜‚).
