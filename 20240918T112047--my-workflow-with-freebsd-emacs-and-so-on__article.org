* private cloud

I use a mini pc as my private cloud server. I tried base operating systems. But none of them make me happy unti I found freebsd. I love freebsd. It is simple, stable, and fast.

** freebsd
*** jails
**** jails1
**** jails2
**** jails3 with bhyve
I install bhyve inside jails to install something that freebsd don't support. such as docker, kubernetes, and so on.
