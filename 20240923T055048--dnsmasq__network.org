dnsmasq is a lightweight DNS forwarder and DHCP server. It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network. It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or in a central configuration file. dnsmasq supports static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP for network booting of diskless machines.
